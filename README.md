# wav2notes v0.1
## Polyphonic Pitch Detection for Classical Guitar Using the Julia Programming Language

#### Refer to the pdf paper in the main repository for algorithmic details.
==================================
### Running the program:
* Tested with the Julia Programming Language v1.8.5 / No problems should occur on other modern versions of Julia
* Install the DSP, Plots, OffsetArrays and Wav packages.
* Navigate to the /src directory in your terminal.
* Open the test.jl file and go to the bottom after reading the comments on top of the main function.
* Modify the example function call for your needs. 

### Reporting issues:
* Discord @faradaykafesi
* Open an issue with the steps and environment to reproduce the issue.

### Future:
* Increasing the precision of the algorithm.
* Support for 6+ String classical guitars.
* Prettier output for the user.
* Possibly a version written in Rust to compile to WASM and run in a browser.
